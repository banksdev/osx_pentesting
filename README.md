# OSX Penetration Testing Tools
This repository contains a shell script that installs ethical hacking tools on OSX.

## Motivation
I became very frustrated with my kali VM. 
Therefore I felt the need to build build a repository of ethical hacking tools on OSX.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide a minimal set of essential ethical hacking tools. i.e. something you want to run on a fresh install, so that you have your *must-have* tools.
